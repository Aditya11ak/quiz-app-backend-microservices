# Quiz App Backend (Microservices Architecture)

This repository contains a **Quiz Application Backend** built using **Microservices Architecture** with **Spring Boot, Java, and MySQL**.  
The project demonstrates how to break down a monolithic application into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other using **Spring Cloud** and **Netflix Eureka**.

## üìå Project Overview

The backend is divided into **three microservices/projects**:

1. **Service Registry**  
   - Built with **Netflix Eureka Server**.  
   - Handles service discovery and registration.  
   - Both `Quiz Service` and `Question Service` register themselves here.

2. **Question Service**  
   - Manages the **question-related operations**.  
   - Provides APIs for admins and quiz service.  
   - Exposes CRUD operations on questions and additional APIs consumed by quiz service.

3. **Quiz Service**  
   - Consumes the `Question Service` APIs to generate and manage quizzes.  
   - Handles quiz creation, fetching quiz questions, and calculating scores.
